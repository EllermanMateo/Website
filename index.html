<p> I come from <strong>Florida</strong>. where weather consists of
  mainly hot and humid days. Generally, the summer is
  the hottest times. The benifit of coming from
    Sunshine State is that I am used to the heat and
    it is useful during competition.</p>
<p> I enjoy <em>Cross Country</em> and Track where my talents
  are really shown. One long-term goal in Andover.</p>
